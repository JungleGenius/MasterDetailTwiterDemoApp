I'm not sure is this project will build with the latest version of Xcode so I'm including a link to Xcode version 7.3 that was used to build this project.

[https://download.developer.apple.com/Developer_Tools/Xcode_7.3.1/Xcode_7.3.1.dmg]

You will need an Apple Developer account to download the Xcode 7.3 installer.

No licence is granted. If you're thinking about stealing my work to pass a coding test you will need to write your own damn code.
